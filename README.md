# DiaSpeak

DiaSpeak is a self-hosted Dockerized application that uses the [`nari-labs/Dia-1.6B`](https://huggingface.co/nari-labs/Dia-1.6B) text-to-speech model to generate high-quality speech audio from text inputs. The output is saved as organized audio files into a structured library for easy access and use.
