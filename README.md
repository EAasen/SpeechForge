# DiaSpeak

DiaSpeak is a self-hosted Dockerized application that uses the [`nari-labs/Dia-1.6B`](https://huggingface.co/nari-labs/Dia-1.6B) text-to-speech model to generate high-quality speech audio from text inputs. The output is saved as organized audio files into a structured library for easy access and use.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Translate any text into natural-sounding speech using Dia-1.6B  
âœ… Save output as high-quality `.wav` or `.mp3` files  
âœ… Automatically organize files into a user-defined library structure  
âœ… REST API endpoint for integration into other applications  
âœ… Configurable output formats, voice settings, and file naming schemes  
âœ… Run locally via Docker with no external API dependency

## ðŸ“¦ Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diaspeak.git
cd diaspeak
docker-compose up --build
```

## ðŸ§µ Async Processing with Celery & Redis

DiaSpeak supports asynchronous TTS job processing using Celery and Redis. This allows you to submit long-running TTS jobs and poll for their status/results without blocking the API.

### Prerequisites
- Docker Compose (for running Redis and the app)
- Celery and Redis Python packages (already in requirements.txt)

### Setup Steps

1. **Add Redis to Docker Compose**

Your `docker-compose.yml` should include a Redis service:

```yaml
services:
  diaspeak:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./outputs:/app/outputs
    container_name: diaspeak_app
    depends_on:
      - redis

  redis:
    image: redis:7
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

2. **Start All Services**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. **Start the Celery Worker**

In a new terminal, run:

```bash
docker-compose exec diaspeak celery -A src.app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

4. **Submit Async TTS Jobs**

POST to `/speak-async` with your text and parameters:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/speak-async \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "Your long text here..."}'
```

You will receive a `job_id` in the response.

5. **Poll Job Status**

Check job status and result:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/job/<job_id>
```

- Status will be `pending`, `processing`, `complete`, or `error`.

6. **Helper Script**

You can use the provided `diaspeak-async.sh` script to start all services and the Celery worker:

```bash
bash diaspeak-async.sh
```

## Troubleshooting: TTS Generation Fails or Audio Output Issues

If you encounter errors such as `TTS generation failed`, missing audio files, or issues with output formats (e.g., MP3/OGG not being produced), follow these steps to resolve common problems:

### 1. Ensure All Dependencies Are Installed
- **Python Packages:**
  - All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them with:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- **FFmpeg:**
  - `ffmpeg` is required for MP3/OGG export via `pydub`.
  - If running in Docker, the provided `Dockerfile` installs ffmpeg. For local installs:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg
    ```
  - Verify ffmpeg is available:
    ```bash
    ffmpeg -version
    ```

### 2. File Permissions
- Ensure the `outputs/` directory exists and is writable by the user running the Flask app or Celery worker.
- If running in Docker, the container should have permissions to write to `/outputs`.

### 3. Model Download Issues
- The first run will download the Dia-1.6B model. If you see errors related to model loading, check your internet connection and available disk space.
- If running in a restricted environment, pre-download the model or set the `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` environment variable to a writable location.

### 4. Redis and Celery (Async Mode)
- For async endpoints (`/speak-async`), ensure Redis is running and accessible at `localhost:6379`.
- Use the provided `diaspeak-async.sh` script or `docker-compose up` to start all services.
- Check logs for errors in the Celery worker or Redis service.

### 5. Common Error Messages
- **`TTS generation failed`**: Check the Flask logs for the full traceback. Common causes:
  - Input text is empty or too large (see chunking settings).
  - Model or dependency issues (see above).
- **`Unsupported format`**: Only `wav`, `mp3`, and `ogg` are supported. Ensure you specify a valid format.
- **`No file part in the request`**: For `/speak-file`, ensure you are sending a file as form-data.

### 6. Debugging Tips
- Run the Flask app in debug mode for more verbose error output:
  ```bash
  FLASK_ENV=development python src/app.py
  ```
- Check the `outputs/catalog.csv` for metadata and file paths of generated audio.
- Use the `/health` endpoint to verify the API is running.

### 7. Still Stuck?
- Open an issue with the error message and relevant logs.
- Include your OS, Python version, and how you are running the app (Docker, local, etc.).
